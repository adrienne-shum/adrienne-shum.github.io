## Introduction
Erroneous eyewitness memory is a leading cause of wrongful convictions. This was evident in Smith and Cutler’s (2013) recent analysis of over 1000 cases of convicted innocent individuals, where mistaken eyewitness identification was involved in half of them. Although evidence for the unreliability of eyewitness memory has built up over the past decades, eyewitness testimony continues to be heavily relied on by the justice system (Wise & Safer, 2004). While laboratory experiments have identified a number of variables that lead to inaccurate eyewitness memory, field research has questioned the extent to which these controlled experiments can be generalised to real life (Yuille and Cutshall, 1986; Christianson & Hubinette, 1993). 
It is important to analyse the specific factors that impact eyewitness memory as it helps us predict the circumstances in which eyewitness testimony will be more or less reliable. To scrutinise these factors in a systematic way, I will explore eyewitness memory in three stages: 1. when the event is first perceived (encoding stage); 2. when memory is retained and potentially misleading information is encountered (post-event stage); and 3. when an account of what happened is retrieved (retrieval stage). 
Each of these stages represents exposure to different risks leading to inaccurate memory recall. I will proceed to evaluate the potential detrimental effects of stress on the encoding stage; leading questions on the post-event stage; and simultaneous lineup presentations on the retrieval stage.

## 1. Encoding
The initial memory process is the encoding stage where an event is first perceived. The literature on the deleterious effects of stress on memory encoding is substantial. In a survey described in Christianson's (1992) critical review, eyewitness experts consistently agreed that stress or event violence, commonly experienced by eyewitnesses, impairs the accuracy of memory. However, early studies have yielded inconsistent findings, suggesting the relationship between stress and memory is non-linear and complicated.
Stress and emotional arousal, often used interchangeably, generally refer to a negative emotional state that leads to both physiological and psychological changes (Aharonian & Bornstein, 2008). Research is split on whether heightened emotional states have a detrimental or helpful effect on memory encoding.
On one hand, researchers have argued that stress impairs the reliability of eyewitness memory. In a laboratory experiment by Clifford and Scott (1978), participants who watched a film clip of a violent attack remembered fewer details about the violent event, compared to those who viewed a less stressful version. This suggests that the stress experienced from watching the violent video led to worsened recall. In support of these findings, Loftus and Bums (1982) showed participants a short video of a bank robbery where half of the participants witnessed a boy being shot in the face and the other half did not. In both recognition and recall testing, participants who saw the violent version recalled significantly fewer details from the film. These laboratory experiments highlight the negative effects of high emotional arousal on memory encoding.
On the other hand, research in neuroscience have suggested that emotional arousal enhances explicit memory. Studies on both humans (Dolcos et al., 2004) and animals (Cahill and McGaugh 1999) have demonstrated that the amygdala plays a pervasive role in modulating memory formation. This research has been supported by evidence which shows that the activation in the basolateral amygdala has enhancing effects on memory formation as it is involved in modulating the consolidation of emotionally arousing experiences (Pelletier et al., 2005). Applied to eyewitness memory, stressful events that are emotionally arousing may yield the opposite result - enhancing eyewitness memory rather than diminishing it. This is buttressed by field studies that suggest that eyewitnesses of stressful violent crimes in real life may have fairly accurate memory recall (Yuille and Cutshall, 1986).
Considering the contradicting findings, Deffenbacher (1994) attempted to explain the discrepancies with the Yerkes-Dodson law, which proposed that varying degree of stress modulates performance in an inverted-U form. Applying this theory to eyewitness memory, it seems to explain the previous contradictory experimental results. During moderate levels of stress, more cognitive resources are made available, while in the experience of high and low levels of stress, rates of mental and response operations are lowered, resulting in less accurate memory recall.
According to this theoretical perspective, one would come to the conclusion that low and high levels of stress impairs eyewitness memory, while moderate levels of stress would improve memory. This account is overly simplistic. First of all, it is unable to specify absolute levels of arousal (Christianson, 1992). Second of all, a number of field experiments appear to dispute the inverted-U hypothesis. Christianson and Hubinette (1993) interviewed over a hundred witnesses from real life bank robberies to understand whether their memory of the robbery would be affected given that they witnessed a highly emotionally arousing and stressful event. Findings revealed that even victims of violence, who have been directly threatened during the robbery, had accurate recollections of the criminals’ clothing and behaviour.
In summary, the effect of stress on eyewitness memories is complex and difficult to generalise. Field experiments that refute the negative effects of stress have higher ecological validity, but researchers have little control over the extraneous variables. Laboratory studies are standardised and well controlled, but there are ethical limits to the level of stress one can induce in participants. Although more research is required to clarify the ambiguous relationship, most authors seem to agree on that high levels of stress do more harm than good to eyewitness memory (Aharonian and Bornstein, 2008).

## 2. Post-event
After a piece of information is first acquired in the encoding stage, it is retained for later use. During the post-event stage, misleading information may be mixed with the original memory, leading to memory distortion. This is known as the misinformation effect (Schooler & Loftus, 1993). One type of post-event information that may bias memory is leading questions. For instance, instead of asking ‘what was the culprit holding?’, a leading question would be ‘What weapon was the culprit holding?’, implying that the culprit was holding a weapon. Leading questions are used fairly often when witnesses are interrogated and interviewed by the police (Bennett, 2015). In one of Loftus and Palmer’s (1974) well known experiments, researchers tested the powerful influences of leading questions on the accuracy of eyewitness memory. Participants were shown a short film of a car crash incident and were asked to give an estimate of the speed of the car. They were then asked the critical question ‘how fast were the cars when they [verb] each other?’ In the five conditions, the verb would either be ‘smashed’, ‘collided’, ‘bumped’, ‘hit’ or ‘contacted’. Consistent with their hypothesis, those who were asked the leading questions with the verb ‘smashed’ gave a significantly higher speed estimate (40.8 mph) than those who were asked with the verb ‘contacted’ (31.8 mph). Despite having seen the exact same video, their speed estimations were moderated by the critical verb used, demonstrating that information gained during the post event stage can distort an eyewitness’ memory. 
These findings are accountable by the schema theory on the reconstructive nature of memory (Bartlett, 1932; Brewer, 2000). Schemas are mental representations that help us categorise and organise information presented to us. Consequently, how we process information is, to a great extent, decided by relevant previous knowledge in our memory. The schema theory helps us understand how leading questions led to a change in participants’ memory representations of the accident. The word ‘smashed’ may have activated slightly different schemas than the word ‘contacted’, which influenced memory on the severity of the accident and speed estimates. Memory of the car crash was altered to be consistent with the activated schema. However, the schema theory’s account for the effects of leading questions is not without flaws. The theory has been criticised for being overly vague, especially in its claim that schemas are not directly observable. Nonetheless, the schema theory allows us to make sense of why eyewitness memories can be highly unreliable. 
Loftus and Palmer offered an alternative account to this phenomenon. Upon perception of a complex event, two kinds of information are obtained: the original event and the external post-event information. The dissimilarity between two sources can lead to memory distortions when they are integrated into ‘one memory’. The experimenters proposed that the external information provided in the leading questions (e.g. the cars ‘smashed’ into each other) integrated with the original memory, which led participants to give a higher speed estimate. The influences of the misinformation effect are so powerful that even when Lindsay (1990) purposely told her participants that the post-event information they will be presented is misleading, it still led to an inaccurate memory recollection. 
The well-controlled experiment demonstrates a causal link between leading questions and unreliable memory recollection. However, the methodological flaws in the study raise doubts about the validity of the conclusions. For example, student participants may not be experienced in estimating speed. Contending the findings of Loftus and Palmer’s study, psychologists have interviewed witnesses of a real-life crime with the same technique using leading questions. Despite intentionally biasing the witnesses with leading questions, participants were still able to accurately recall details of an attempted robbery, even after four to five months (Yuille & Cutshall, 1986). However, the credibility of the conclusions are weakened by the inherent limitations of the field experiments. It was possible that the participants were very close to the events and the researchers are unable to control how much details they have seen. Furthermore, researchers only studied the responses of 13 witnesses in one unique event.
To summarise, it is rather unfair to generalise findings of field studies to criticise laboratory experiments. Having said that, field studies have shed light to some key differences in eyewitness memory between laboratory and real-life settings. Experimental tasks, such as the one in Loftus and Palmer’s study, lack mundane realism (Eysenck & Keane, 2010). Participants were asked to recall relatively trivial aspects (e.g., speed of car) as opposed to central details of the crime (e.g., facial features of a criminal). Furthermore, cases of mistaken eyewitness identification in court have real and severe outcomes. Consequently, witnesses in real life may be more motivated to recall the event accurately.

## 3. Retrieval 
It is evident from the discussion above that memory distortions may occur when a witness first perceives a crime event and when he/she retains the memory trace. Research also suggests that biases may affect memory reliability when eyewitnesses are asked to retrieve their memory of a crime during identification procedures. The recognition task that an eyewitness has to go through is known as a police lineup, a process where the witness is shown people or photos of people, consisting of suspects and distractors who are certain to be innocent. In hopes of identifying the culprit in question, witnesses are asked to indicate the person involved in the crime event. Typical lineup structures include the simultaneous and the sequential lineup. In the former, suspects are presented to the eyewitness at the same time. In the latter, witnesses view the suspects one at a time. 
An unbiased lineup procedure is of vital importance in retrieving reliable eyewitness memory. Traditionally, simultaneous lineups have been used by the law enforcement, yet, a body of research comparing the two typical lineups suggests that simultaneous lineups increase rates of false identifications. In an experiment by Lindsay and Wells (1985), participants witnessed a staged crime where a confederate stole a calculator from the room. They found that a sequential lineup presentation, compared to simultaneous, yielded fewer false identification from the participants. In simultaneous presentations, witnesses are prompted to use a ‘relative judgement strategy’ where they select the photo or person who looks most like the culprit relative to the other lineup members. In contrast, a sequential presentation allows witnesses to use an ‘absolute judgement’, where they compare each photograph only to their memory of the culprit. Wells (1984) argued that the reliance on relative judgement affects the reliability eyewitness memory which results in wrongful identifications.
The findings of Lindsay and Wells’ experiment, however, have not been supported by real-life studies. Comparisons of field data of sequential and simultaneous lineups found results that contradict their laboratory findings, which suggest that a simultaneous presentation is more preferable (Mecklenburg, Bailey, Larson, 2008). Having said that, this study itself has been heavily criticised for how it has been implemented. One of the major flaws was that the set of crimes investigated through simultaneous lineups was different from the set of crimes investigated with sequential lineups.
More recent reviews have argued against either of the lineup presentations being superior to each other. In a large study with 2529 participants, Gronlund et al. (2009) conducted 24 comparisons of the two typical lineup presentations and revealed no significant evidence for sequential advantages in the real world. Similarly, using real eyewitnesses, no significance difference was found between sequential and simultaneous procedures in the rates of identifying lineup suspects (Wells, Steblay, & Dysart, 2014). A possible explanation is that although sequential lineups decrease rates of false identifications, they also encourage more conservative responses, which means an eyewitness is less likely to make an identification.
Recent studies seem to agree that there is no significant advantage for conducting lineups either sequentially or simultaneously. Perhaps more research is needed to confidently reveal which lineup presentation is superior to the other. Meanwhile, law enforcement should focus their efforts on improving other aspects of the lineup procedure, such as leading questions, that may affect the reliability of eyewitness memory.

## Conclusions and implications to the courtroom 
In conclusion, it is evident that high levels of stress and leading eyewitness questioning can impede and prejudice the reliability of eyewitness memory and eyewitness statements. Whilst there is insufficient evidence to prove the case for different lineup presentations, this finding should be acknowledged and considered in the judicial process, especially when a conviction is solely based on eyewitness testimony. Nevertheless, the value of eyewitness testimonies should by no means be disregarded as they can be important leads in forensic investigations. 
With the benefit of decades of research in this area to inform our understanding of the causes of memory distortion, jurisdictions should implement changes to mitigate effects of system variables, for instance prohibiting the use of leading questions during witness interviews. For the estimator variables that the court cannot control (e.g., the malleable nature of human memory; Wells, 1978), these should be taken into account when deciding the weight to be given to eyewitness testimony.
