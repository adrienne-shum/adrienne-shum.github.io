Attachment can be defined as the *"lasting psychological connectedness between human beings."* [1] This can be formed between an individual and her mother, father, caregiver and romantic partner. Early attachment experiences form an important foundation for our later social and emotional development and our mental health. For instance, some psychologists strongly believe that a secure attachment is associated with less engagement in high risk behaviours, fewer mental health problems, and enhanced social skills and coping strategies [1]. Having said that, some children who grew up in extreme conditions (e.g. rough orphanages) were able to thrive in life, develop healthy relationships with others and maintain good mental health [2]. So which one is it? How important is a healthy attachment in childhood to our psychological development in later life? 
To answer this question, it would be helpful to explore why some theorists, namely John Bowlby, would suggest a positive correlation between attachment and mental health.

## Internal Working Model

The argument that early attachment experiences shape children’s social and emotional functioning) was based on this mechanism called the Internal Working Model (IWM). The IWM is a cognitive framework comprising mental representations for understanding the world, self, and others. A person’s interaction with others is guided by memories and expectations from their IWM which influence and help evaluate their contact with others [3]. With this framework in mind, we can now proceed to evaluating the evidence. 

Mental health is an extremely broad area. What does having a good mental health even mean? Broadly speaking, a good mental health would consist of a positive self concept, healthy emotion regulation, minimal to no externalising and internalising behaviour. Here is the full list of areas I will be discussing:

 * Personality characteristics (e.g. resilience, dependency, confidence...)
 * Emotion regulation
 * Self-concept
 * Externalising & internalising behaviour
 * Mental disorders 

## Personality characteristics
To begin with, let us look into how early attachment affects personality as children grow up. This association was explored in the Minnesota Study of Risk and Adaptation from Birth to Adulthood [4]. In this prospective longitudinal study, children were recruited in infancy with their families and followed through age 34 years. Semi-structured observations were conducted at 12 and 18 months. In the years that followed, personality characteristics were assessed regularly through a range of measures including self reports,  behavioural observations, interviews. 

Findings show significant associations between early attachment security and personality characteristics throughout childhood and adolescence. By the age of 3.5 years, children who had secure attachments were significantly more competent in the lab setting, scored higher on the integrative projected self-esteem scale, had higher ratings of ego resiliency, were rated as dramatically more resilient by teachers, and had fewer social or behavioural problems. By middle childhood, attachment still significantly related to major outcomes up to 10 years later (p. 153). Children with secure histories were rated higher on social competence, lower on dependency, and higher in emotional health/self-esteem Infant attachment predicted numerous aspects of functioning in relationships by age 21 (e.g. emotional health, self esteem, self confidence, social competence in interacting ith peers). However, elementary school competence and parent-child interactions at age 13 significantly added to predictions. Thus, this research demonstrated that although the effects of early attachment is evident throughout development, other issues (such as stress, support, and ongoing care) are significant to the development of the child even into adulthood.  
This shows that attachment style and personality have strong associations but it is emphasised that both developmental history and current experience are also important in shaping personality growth. Therefore, the answer is not that simple. Attachment security does influence personality outcomes but because personality is multi-determined, early attachment is only one of many constituent influences.

## Emotion regulation
Next up - emotions! 

Emotion regulation (ER) is the ability to respond to the ongoing demands of experience with the range of emotions in a manner that is socially tolerable and sufficiently flexible to permit spontaneous reactions as well as the ability to delay spontaneous reactions as needed. Attachment style is thought to be associated with ER because through parent’s acceptance and recognition of children’s emotions and willingness to communicate openly about emotions, it fosters children’s developing emotional awareness and scaffold the growth of competent flexible skills in emotion self-regulation [5].

Association between secure attachment and ER can be observed in neurobiological & behavioural studies. In one study [6], researchers looked into the relationship between poor attachment and cortisol level (an indicator of stress response). When exposed to novel events, elevations in cortisol were found only for 18 months toddlers in insecure attachment. For  toddlers in secure relationships, the mothers’ presence helped to buffer the physiological effects of novel events. In a behavioural study [7], boys who were securely attached at age 1.5 were observed to use more constructive anger management strategies during a frustrating task. Boys with a healthy attachment waited quietly and asked questions much more often than boys with a poor attachment style.

## Self-concept
Self-concept is a strong indicator of good mental health as it is the conception of ourselves being loved/worthy of being loved. In a study comparing 6 year olds who are either securely or insecurely attached [8], they found that children who were securely attached tend to explicitly describe themselves in generally positive terms in a puppet interview while being capable of admitting that they were imperfect. On the other hand, insecurely attached children either revealed a more negative self-image or resisted admitting flaws. Researchers explored the results with a different methodology to test whether the findings extended to implicit self-concept. In this study [9], they examined the association between security and children’s preference for receiving positive/negative feedback about self. Researchers found that secure attachment was associated with seeking more positive feedback about self. 

## Externalising and internalising behaviour
Externalising (e.g. physical aggression, cheating, stealing) and internalising behaviour (fearfulness, social withdrawal) are signs of mental health difficulties. In a recent meta-analysis on attachment and externalising behaviour, insecure attachment was associated with later externalising problems (significant, d=0.31). Interestingly, larger effects were found in boys and in clinical samples. Children with a disorganised attachment were at the largest risk for developing externalising behaviour problems.

In other meta-analysis [10], poor attachment was also found to be associated with internalising behaviour. The associations were significant but small (d=0.15), making it difficult to tease apart the effect of attachment and other characteristics, e.g. temperament.

## Mental disorders
Last but not least, and perhaps the most basic definition of good mental health is the absence of mental disease. Some research [11] have shown that attachment insecurity is closely linked to mental disorders. In a large-scale literature review (hundreds of cross-sectional, longitudinal, and prospective studies of both clinical and non-clinical samples), psychologists found that attachment insecurity was common among people with a wide variety of mental disorders. This included mild distress to severe personality disorders and even schizophrenia. However, cautious steps must be taken when interpreting these results. The statistics show a correlation between attachment and psychopathology which means the relationship is non-determinant instead of  causal. 

The causal link between attachment and psychopathology is further complicated by bidirectional ambiguity. Other research findings have shown that psychological problems can increase attachment insecurity. A study [12] found that late adolescent women who became less securely attached over periods of 6 - 24 months were more likely than their peers to have a history of psychopathology. 

All in all, there is evidence that an attachment-insecure attachment link exists but it is clear that a causal relationship cannot be established. Other factors are likely to intersect with or heighten the effects of attachment on the way to mental disorders.

## Final thoughts
A maltreated child with an insecure attachment style may develop positive self-concepts, grow up to become resilient to stress and be able to regulate their emotions. Similarly, a child with secured attachment may develop mental disorders in later life. A simple answer to the blogpost question is - no, a secure attachment is not *essential* for good mental health. It remains unclear how the effects of attachment interact with other risk factors when determining children's outcomes (e.g., genetically determined temperament, intelligence, life history, including maltreatment). Having said that, this should not undermine the importance and value of a secure attachment. As reviewed in the five areas above, it is evident that an insecure attachment style is a strong risk factor that may increase vulnerability to poor mental health. This highlights the importance for primary caregivers to create a safe space for their child to form a secure attachment with them.
