        <h1>Adrienne Shum</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am Adrienne, a recent psychology graduate from University College London. 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with childhood cancer, which dramatically changed my life along with those around me. I remember spending a substantial amount of time in and out of hospitals and leaving school for a year. It was a disruptive period of my life but I also gained the opportunity to experience the debilitating effects of childhood anxiety and learnt to appreciate the importance of mental health support. This experience left in me a deep impression. I became interested in understanding why people experience mental health struggles and to wanted to learn how to help them. This motivated me to pursue psychology for my International Baccalaureate and undergraduate studies. Ever since, it has been my dream to pursue a doctorate in clinical psychology and train to become a psychologist to help others. As I prepare for my desired career as a psychologist in the mental health sector, I hope to find opportunities to gain practical skills, relevant competencies and most importantly, develop the sensitivities of the profession. </a></p>
